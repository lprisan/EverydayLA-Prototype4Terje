## Plan/Activities

Planned time: 90-120 mins


### 1. Intro to the session goals and structure **[5']**
* Everybody should navigate to this website, at [https://goo.gl/Q45YDB](https://goo.gl/Q45YDB){:target="_blank"}{:style="font-size:300%"}
* ![... or scan this!](assets/qr.png){:height="450px"}

### 2. Student presentation rounds **[20' each]**
* Student presents main ideas of their proposal (in less than 15 mins)
* After the presentation, **presenting student** answers [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnPY0dLCSVt44_w7M7jiGyFzL4dt5MZ4oqi4vQ_yxphyowrA/viewform){:target="_blank"}
* After the presentation, **audience** answers [this other form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJf4Ki9H2NtxsV-1kM2oFdfEWZI6qWQVHpdf_JnFknFTDDSw/viewform){:target="_blank"}
* Finally, the student goes to [his/her dashboard](https://luispprieto.shinyapps.io/dashboard4terje/#section-student){:target="_blank"}, looks at the questions available, and picks the most important ones. Meanwhile, the next student sets up for presenting.

### 3. Breakout groups **[25']**
* Audience breaks out into small groups around each of the presenting students
* Small groups do as many iterations as possible of:
    1. The student picks up an important question from [his/her dashboard](https://luispprieto.shinyapps.io/dashboard4terje/#section-student){:target="_blank"} (own or posed by audience), and poses it to the small group
    2. The small group responds or gives any other input. The student takes notes of the responses/ideas/conclusions, and next actions in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXANsd10kNwAneP7sMSA2apJq7soVFAeVUt6_iI7aYZmxTGA/viewform){:target="_blank"}
    3. When there are no more ideas, or the student feels another question should be posed, go back to 1.

### 4. Wrap-up and questionnaire **[15']**
* The session chair opens up [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbBu_NACzyubZdSpXejMnNaMOHEHZVtSSamRpd0A7dCuGYNw/viewform){:target="_blank"}, to take notes of the session conclusions
* Each presenting student summarizes in **1 minute** the most interesting thing they've learned in the session
* The floor is opened to the audience to note (briefly!) other interesting lessons learned in the session
* The session chair opens up the [session dashboard](https://luispprieto.shinyapps.io/dashboard4terje/#section-overall){:target="_blank"}, and shows it to the participants
* Finally, the teacher asks students to reflect on their learning experience today (and reflects him/herself), [using the Prolearning tool](http://prolearning.realto.ch/){:target="_blank"}.
    * IMPORTANT: this questionnaire is **anonymous**, and it is used for the teacher's own understanding and the improvement of the course. This kind of reflection/self-assessment exercises have been shown to be very effective in increasing learning outcomes
