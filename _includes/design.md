## Plan/Activities

Planned time: 90-120 mins


### 1. Intro to the session goals and structure **[5']**
* Everybody should navigate to this website, at [...goo.gl.URL...](...goo.gl.URL...){:target="_blank"}{:style="font-size:300%"}
* ![... or scan this!](assets/qr.png){:height="450px"}

### 2. Student presentation rounds **[20' each]**
* Student presents main ideas of their dissertation (less than 15 mins)
* After the presentation, **presenting student** answers [this form](...form.1b.URL...){:target="_blank"}
* After the presentation, **audience** answers [this other form](...form.1a.URL...m){:target="_blank"}
* Finally, the student goes to [his/her dashboard](...dashboard.student.URL...){:target="_blank"}, looks at the questions available, and picks the most important ones. Meanwhile, the next student sets up for presenting.

### 3. Breakout groups **[25']**
* Audience breaks out into small groups around each of the presenting students
* As many iterations as possible of:
    1. The student picks up an important question from [his/her dashboard](...dashboard.student.URL...){:target="_blank"} (own or posed by audience), and poses it to the small group
    2. The small group responds or gives any other input. The student takes notes of the responses/ideas/conclusions, and next actions in [this form](...form.2.URL...){:target="_blank"}
    3. When there are no more ideas, or the student feels another question should be posed, go back to 1.

### 4. Wrap-up **[10']**
* The session chair opens up [this form](...form.3.URL...){:target="_blank"}, to take notes of the session conclusions
* Each presenting student summarizes in **1 minute** the most interesting thing they've learned in the session
* The floor is opened to the audience to note (briefly!) other interesting lessons learned in the session
* The session chair opens up the [session dashboard](...dashboard.session.URL...){:target="_blank"}, and shows it to the participants
